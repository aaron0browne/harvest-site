            <h2>A Word on Data Quality</h2>
            <p>While Harvest can make a lot of things simpler, it won't magically make messy, disorganized data clean.
                Unless your data is coming from a very well controlled, curated data source, it's likely that you
                will have to put some manual effort into data cleanup. How much effort depends entirely on the data
                source. In our experience with biomedical data, pulling data from active, electronic health records requires considerable cleaning, whereas
                something like an electronic case report form tends to have a better structure since it was designed upfront for ease of analysis</p>
            
            <p>All that being said, don't be discouraged if you've got messy data. One of the pleasant surprises about putting data into Harvest
                is that it gives you a very easy way to monitor data quality. Because the user interface components are all generated dynamically from
                your data, it's easy to see when a particular field needs some attention. Numerical outliers will skew your histograms, and uncontrolled
                vocabularies will cause your bar graphs and pick lists to have too many obviously overlapping items. You may also find that some fields
                that you consider important may not be as frequently populated as you had hoped. Because you get started looking at your data early in
                the deployment process, you can iterate rapidly to clean and organize the data, seeing the impacts in the live application immediately.</p>
            <h2>Data Models</h2>
            <p>In order to perform all the dynamic queries and displays in Harvest, you'll need to adhere to a few general data modeling rules. These are
               covered in greater detail later, but briefly they are as follows:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Avoid excessive use of key/value data structures unless absolutely necessary</li>
                   <li>All tables should have a single primary key column, composite keys are not allowed</li>
                   <li>Avoid circular references</li>
                   <li>Overly normalized schemas can become unwieldy when loading and managing data</li>
                   <li>Consider aggregating multi-row data that users may want to see in a single row of output</li>
                   <li>Try to decompose complex values (e.g. measurements and units) into individual database columns</li>
                   
              </ul>
              <p>While some of the above requirements may seem limiting at first, they force a simple, predictable data model that is
                  easily traversed by the automated tools embedded in Harvest while at the same time providing a good experience for end
                  users.</p>
