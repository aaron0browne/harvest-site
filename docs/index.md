<p class=lead>We are in the process of organizing and updating the Harvest documentation as it has become fragmented across various sites.</p>

If you have any immediate questions, head over to the [chatroom]({{ site.baseurl }}chat/) to get help or email us directly at info@harvest.io. If you would like to contribute to this process, head over to the [Harvest site issues](https://github.com/cbmi/harvest-site/issues/) to see what needs to be done.

If you want to know how to download and setup a Harvest application, head over to the [download page]({{ site.baseurl }}download/). Otherwise feel free to look at the existing technical documentation separated by Harvest component:

- http://avocado.harvest.io
- http://serrano.harvest.io
- http://cilantro.harvest.io
- http://modeltree.harvest.io

Thank you for your patience!
